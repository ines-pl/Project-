    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>
      I want to help people make healthier choices, including myself. I will be
      posting weekly workouts, recipes and motivation for people. With the
      recipes containing calorie counts and nutritional breakdowns. This will be
      the ultimate guide to living your best healthy life.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <p>
      There has been a recent uptick in the ammount of people focusing on
      fitness and getting themselves healthy since covid and lock-down happened.
      I have also shifted my lifestyle to be healthier. I want to make this
      website to not only motivate me but also help other people stay on the
      healthy wave. On the recipe page I am hoping to set up a random recipe
      generator, as I am a very indecisive person and never know what I want to
      eat, so this could be an added feature I could go back to use in the
      future.
    </p>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <p>
      My target audience is other young girls either hoping to start their
      fitness journey or to help those struggling to stay on their journey.
