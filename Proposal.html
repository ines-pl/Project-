    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>
      This website will be a place for children of portuguese immigrants to feel
      more connected to Portugal. I believe a large part of feeling connected to
      any culture is to do with the food, therefore there are 3 pages dedicated
      to the food of Portugal.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <p>
      As the child of an immigrant, I always felt a little distant from my
      parents heritage, but also distant from the place I was born. I want to
      create a page where people can come to learn more about their culture.
    </p>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm hoping this website will be able to help other children of immigrants
      feel closer to their background, making them feel more like they belong
      rather than outsiders on both sides. At the moment there are more
      portuguese people living outside of Portugal than inside the country, so
      there is a large audience potential.
