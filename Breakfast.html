    <ul id="ingredients">
      <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
      <li>
        2 cups minus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour plus more for the work
        surface
      </li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold water</li>
      <li>
        2 sticks (8 oz) unsalted butter room temperature, stirred until smooth
      </li>

      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups milk divided</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>2/3 cup water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>6 large egg yolks whisked</li>
    </ul>
    <ol id="method">
      <strong id="title">Instructions:</strong>
      <li>
        In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix the flour, salt, and
        water until a soft, pillowy dough forms that pulls away from the side of
        the bowl, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generously flour a work surface and pat the dough into a 6-inch (15-cm)
        square using a pastry scraper. Flour the dough, cover with plastic wrap,
        and let it rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the dough into an 18-inch (46-cm) square. As you work, use the
        scraper to lift the dough to make sure the underside isn't sticking to
        your work surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the excess flour off the top of the dough, trim any uneven edges,
        and, using a small offset spatula, dot and then spread the left 2/3
        portion of the dough with a little less than 1/3 of the butter being
        careful to leave a 1 inch (25 mm) plain border around the edge of the
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold the unbuttered right 1/3 of the dough (using the pastry scraper to
        loosen it if it sticks) over the rest of the dough. Brush off any excess
        flour, then fold over the left 1/3 of the dough. Starting from the top,
        pat down the dough with your hand to release any air bubbles, and then
        pinch the edges of the dough to seal. Brush off any excess flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough 90° to the left so the fold is facing you. Lift the dough
        and flour the work surface. Once again roll it out to an 18-inch (46-cm)
        square, then dot the left 2/3 of the dough with 1/3 of the butter and
        smear it over the dough. Fold the dough as directed in steps 4 and 5.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the last rolling, turn the dough 90° to the left and roll out the
        dough to an 18-by-21-inch (46-by-53-cm) rectangle, with the shorter side
        facing you. Spread the remaining butter over the entire surface of the
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the spatula as an aid, lift the edge of dough closest to you and
        roll the dough away from you into a tight log, brushing the excess flour
        from the underside as you go. Trim the ends and cut the log in half.
        Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours or preferably
        overnight. (The pastry can be frozen for up to 3 months.)
      </li>

      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk the flour and 1/4 cup milk (60 ml) until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the sugar, cinnamon, and water to a boil in a small saucepan and
        cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 220°F (104°C). Do not
        stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in another small saucepan, scald the remaining 1 cup milk
        (237 ml). Whisk the hot milk into the flour mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cinnamon stick and then pour the sugar syrup in a thin stream
        into the hot milk-and-flour mixture, whisking briskly. Add the vanilla
        and stir for a minute until very warm but not hot. Whisk in the yolks,
        strain the mixture into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside.
        The custard will be thin; that is as it should be. (You can refrigerate
        the custard for up to 3 days.)
      </li>

      <li>
        Place an oven rack in the top third position and heat the oven to 550°F
        (290°C). Remove a pastry log from the refrigerator and roll it back and
        forth on a lightly floured surface until it's about an inch (25 mm) in
        diameter and 16 inches (41 cm) long. Cut it into scant 3/4-inch (18-mm)
        pieces. Place 1 piece pastry dough, cut side down, in each well of a
        nonstick 12-cup mini-muffin pan (2-by-5/8-inch [50-by-15-mm] size). If
        using classic tins, cut the dough into generous 1-inch (25-mm) pieces.
        Allow the dough pieces to soften several minutes until pliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have a small cup of water nearby. Dip your thumbs in the water, then
        straight down into the middle of the dough spiral. Flatten it against
        the bottom of the cup to a thickness of about 1/16 inch (1.5 mm), then
        smooth the dough up the sides and create a raised lip about 1/8 inch (3
        mm) above the pan. The pastry bottoms should be thinner than the tops.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill each cup 3/4 full with the cool custard. Bake the pastries until
        the edges of the dough are frilled and brown, about 8 to 9 minutes for
        the mini-muffin tins, 15 to 17 minutes for the classic tins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and allow the pasteis to cool a few minutes in the
        pan, then transfer to a rack and cool until just warm. Sprinkle the
        pasteis generously with confectioners' sugar, then cinnamon and serve.
        Repeat with the remaining pastry and custard. These are best consumed
        the day they're made.
      </li>
