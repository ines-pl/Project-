    <h2>Brief Overview of Portugal's History:</h2>
    <p>
      Portugal is one of the oldest countries in Europe. Portuguese civilization
      traces its origins back to the Iron Age, when groups of Lusitanians
      inhabited the interior region of Portugal. Up until the passing of their
      commander, Viriathus, they were renowned for successfully stopping the
      Roman armies. Because of this the tribe was regarded by the Romans as a
      worthy competitor, thus they named the whole territory of modern Portugal
      after them. Romans built a variety of structures, some of which may still
      be seen in various regions of the country, including baths, temples,
      bridges, theatres, and statues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roman rule lasted until the Germanic tribes invaded in the 5th century
      and Portugal consequently became controlled by the Germanic. Then the
      Islamic Umayyad Caliphate invaded in the 8th century. They managed to
      conquer and settle in the south. Portugal has kept many things from them
      till this day, inlcuding the beautiful tiles you see on a lot of the
      buildings around Portugal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1139 Afonso Henriques, the son of a knight who was later crowned Count
      of Portugal, proclaimed himself king of Portugal. The south was won back
      from the Moors in 1249. They then went on to have several wars with Spain
      and make alliances with England. During the age of discovery Portugal
      built a large empire, spanning from Oceania to South America.
    </p>
    <p>
      The empire they had built started to decline around the 15th century when
      the English, French and Dutch started to invade. In 1578 they lost their
      king and in 1755 the capital, Lisbon, was detroyed in an earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1910 the republic was created and the monarchy was abolished. This
      republic that was created was extremely secular and it thus came to end in
      1926 as a result of a military coup. What came after was not much better
      as the dictator Salazar came in to power. The day of the revolution was
      the 25th of April 1974, and to this day the Portuguese people have a
      national holiday on te 25th of April and celebrate, naming it Portuguese
      Independence day. This revolution led to the independence of all
      Portuguese colonies.
